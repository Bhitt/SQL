STEP 1) Write this schema:

	STUDENTS			PAPERS
	- id				- title
	- first_name		- grade
						- student_id (points at students.id)



	CREATE TABLE students (
	    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	    first_name VARCHAR(100)
	);

	CREATE TABLE papers (
	    title VARCHAR(100),
	    grade INT,
	    student_id INT,
	    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) 
	        REFERENCES students(id)
	        ON DELETE CASCADE
	);




STEP 2) Insert this data : 
	
	INSERT INTO students (first_name) VALUES 
	('Caleb'), 
	('Samantha'), 
	('Raj'), 
	('Carlos'), 
	('Lisa');
	 
	INSERT INTO papers (student_id, title, grade ) VALUES
	(1, 'My First Book Report', 60),
	(1, 'My Second Book Report', 75),
	(2, 'Russian Lit Through The Ages', 94),
	(2, 'De Montaigne and The Art of The Essay', 98),
	(4, 'Borges and Magical Realism', 89);

STEP 3) Print out joins :

	SELECT first_name, title, grade
	FROM students
	INNER JOIN papers
	    ON students.id = papers.student_id
	ORDER BY grade DESC;

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	SELECT first_name, title, grade
	FROM students
	LEFT JOIN papers
	    ON students.id = papers.student_id;

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	SELECT
	    first_name,
	    IFNULL(title, 'MISSING'),
	    IFNULL(grade, 0)
	FROM students
	LEFT JOIN papers
	    ON students.id = papers.student_id;

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	SELECT
	    first_name,
	    IFNULL(AVG(grade), 0) AS average
	FROM students
	LEFT JOIN papers
	    ON students.id = papers.student_id
	GROUP BY students.id
	ORDER BY average DESC;

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	SELECT first_name, 
	       Ifnull(Avg(grade), 0) AS average, 
	       CASE 
	         WHEN Avg(grade) IS NULL THEN 'FAILING' 
	         WHEN Avg(grade) >= 75 THEN 'PASSING' 
	         ELSE 'FAILING' 
	       end                   AS passing_status 
	FROM   students 
	       LEFT JOIN papers 
	              ON students.id = papers.student_id 
	GROUP  BY students.id 
	ORDER  BY average DESC;
