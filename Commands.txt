show databases;
	- shows the databases

CREATE DATABASE <name>;
	- creates a database with the given name
	- do not include <>
	- recommended to write name in snake case : database_name

DROP DATABASE <name>;
	- deletes the database
	- be careful with this command

USE <database name>;
	- switches to a database to perform actions on
	- useful for switching between databases

SELECT database();
	- tells you which database is being used
	- returns null if no database is in use

CREATE TABLE tablename
	(
		column_name datatype,
		column_name datatype
	);


	- table names should be pluralized (ie 'cats')

SHOW TABLES;
	- shows the tables in the db
	- does not show the information/details for the tables

SHOW COLUMNS FROM <table name>;
	- gives the description of a table's columns (headers)
	- another method to achieve this is the command: DESC <table name>;

DESC <table name>;
	- similar to SHOW COLUMNS FROM <table name>;
	- minor differences

DROP TABLE <table name>;
	- deletes a table
	- be careful with this command
